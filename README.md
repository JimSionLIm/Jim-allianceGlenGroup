<h2>IFttt</h2>
1. It's surprising that i did not have to do anything at all from GitHub "Actions".<br>
2. The setup was done everything from the IFTTT and Telegram API. (mostly IFTTT)<br>
3. Basically just point and click selected links and trigger actions.<br>
4. And within Telegram, you must first install desktop into Windows. And then create a bot + channel<br>
5. Then add the IFTTT telegram bot into your telegram channel, basically the bot-channel in which you wish to receive the message.
