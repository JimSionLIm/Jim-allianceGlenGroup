<h1>My Steps to enabling Telegram Auto Messaging on Commit events</h1>

1. It's surprising that i did not have to do anything at all from GitHub "Actions".
2. The setup was done everything from the IFTTT and Telegram API. (mostly IFTTT)
3. Basically just point and click selected links and trigger actions.
4. And within Telegram, you must first install desktop into Windows. And then create a bot + channel
5. Then add the IFTTT telegram bot into your telegram channel, basically the bot-channel in which you wish to receive the message.


<h1> Next Steps </h1>
1. Learn how "Actions" work. 
2. Learn Workflow syntax for GitHub Actions
